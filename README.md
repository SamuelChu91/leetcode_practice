# Leetcode_Practice
Daily group coding practice with Data Structures and Algorithms

## Goals
1. Impprove base foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms by solving different leetcode problems
2. Refine teamwork and professional communication skills by initially whtieboarding the problems and then coding on a machine
3. Enhance git proficiency by imitating a proper git group project workflow
4. Increase repertoire of coding languages. Initial problems will be done in Python
